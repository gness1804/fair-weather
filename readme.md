## Fair Weather

This is a simple Google Chrome extension that offers forecast data. It allows the user to enter in any valid five-digit US zip code and then retrieve the current temperature and an icon representing the current weather state (rainy, sunny, etc.). The app saves the user's last entry to `localStorage`, so it will appear (and update) the next time the user opens to app. There is also a link at the bottom for the extended forecast for that city.
